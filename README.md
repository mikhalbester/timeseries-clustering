# Time Series Clustering (Whole)
An exploration and basic implementation of various time series clustering algorithms, partially motivated by the need to compare user consistency with certain behaviors. For example, taking regular blood pressure readings. Are there ways to group at-risk behavior groups together and thus plan an intervention? Since we're not concerned the reading values themselves but only when and how often they are taken, applications extend well beyond blood pressure readings to any interaction that is intended to have some sort of regularity.
