# Time Series Clustering (Whole)
An exploration and basic implementation of various time series clustering algorithms, partially motivated by the need to compare user consistency with certain behaviors. For example, taking regular blood pressure readings. Are there ways to group at-risk behavior groups together and thus plan an intervention?
